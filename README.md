<h1 align="center"> AWFixer's NixOS Config</h1>

tl;dr: this is an advanced config for a nixos system. If you want to use it, generate a repo from the template button and change the users subdirectory to your username.

it has some things in it that i am currently working on. This config is a watered down version of what I use for offsec work. I am going to be publishing the source code for a few of my tools soon, so you will find them moved from the users subdirectory to the nixos modules. for now this is a WIP and you should talk to me on my [Discord] before using it.

there is a temp hardware config file in this repo, that will be removed when I fix the disks.nix file
