## [2024-10-29] - Code Quality & Automation Release

### Added

#### Development Infrastructure
- **Pre-commit Hook System**: Comprehensive automated code quality validation
  - Nix code formatting with `nixpkgs-fmt`
  - Static analysis with `statix` for best practices
  - YAML/JSON/TOML validation
  - Trailing whitespace and file consistency checks
  - Large file prevention
  - Secret detection and security scanning

#### Git Automation
- **Pre-commit Hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`):
  - Validates Nix flake syntax and evaluation
  - Automatically formats Nix files
  - Checks for potential secrets in code
  - Validates documentation structure
  - Prevents commits with large files

- **Pre-push Hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-push`):
  - Runs comprehensive NixOS system builds
  - Validates Home Manager configurations
  - Checks for uncommitted changes
  - Scans commit history for security issues
  - Ensures branch is up to date with upstream

#### Flake Enhancements
- **Enhanced Development Shell**: Added code quality tools
  - `nixpkgs-fmt`: Nix code formatter
  - `statix`: Nix linter and static analyzer
  - `pre-commit`: Hook management framework

- **Flake Checks Output**: Comprehensive validation system
  - `nixpkgs-fmt`: Code formatting validation
  - `statix`: Nix linting and best practices
  - `pre-commit-check`: Full pre-commit hook validation
  - `docs-links`: Documentation structure validation
  - `nixos-config`: System build verification

#### Documentation Improvements
- **Enhanced Development Guide**: Comprehensive workflow documentation
  - Pre-commit system setup and usage
  - Code quality automation processes
  - Flake checks and CI/CD integration
  - Git hooks functionality and purpose

- **VitePress Configuration**: Fixed navigation structure
  - Removed references to non-existent documentation files
  - Reorganized sidebar for existing content
  - Improved user experience with working links

#### Security Enhancements
- **Secrets Management**: Automated secret detection
  - `.secrets.baseline`: Baseline for detect-secrets tool
  - Pre-commit integration for secret scanning
  - Git hook validation for sensitive data

- **Code Security**: Static analysis and validation
  - Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
  - Security-focused linting rules
  - Safe coding practice enforcement

### Technical Details

#### Configuration Files Added
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Pre-commit hook configuration
- `.secrets.baseline`: Secrets detection baseline
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit`: Automated commit validation
- `.git/hooks/pre-push`: Comprehensive push validation

#### Development Workflow Enhancements
- **One-time Setup**: `nix develop` + `pre-commit install`
- **Automated Validation**: Every commit and push
- **Manual Execution**: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- **CI/CD Ready**: `nix flake check` for continuous integration

#### Quality Metrics
- **Zero-config**: Works out of the box with development shell
- **Fast Feedback**: Quick validation during development
- **Comprehensive**: Covers syntax, style, security, and functionality
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new checks and validations

### Benefits
- **Consistency**: Automated code formatting and style enforcement
- **Security**: Prevents accidental secret commits and security issues
- **Reliability**: Validates configurations before they can break the system
- **Efficiency**: Catches issues early in the development process
- **Documentation**: Ensures documentation stays current and accessible

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Setup development environment
nix develop

# Install hooks (one-time)
pre-commit install

# Manual validation
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific checks
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.statix
nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.nixpkgs-fmt

# Full system validation
nix flake check
```

This release significantly improves the development experience by automating code quality checks, preventing common issues, and ensuring consistent, secure, and reliable configuration management.
