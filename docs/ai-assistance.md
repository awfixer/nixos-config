- **Configuration Conflicts**: Identifying and fixing option conflicts
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving build and runtime performance

## Interaction Patterns

### Effective AI Collaboration

**Specific Requests**
```bash
# Good: Specific, actionable requests
"Add a module for Docker with auto-pruning and user permissions"
"Fix the VitePress configuration dead links"
"Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality"

# Less effective: Vague requests
"Make the config better"
"Fix everything"
```

**Context Provision**
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Describe the intended functionality
- Mention any constraints or requirements
- Include error messages when troubleshooting

**Iterative Development**
- Start with basic implementation
- Refine based on testing results
- Add documentation incrementally
- Validate against best practices

### Best Practices for AI Assistance

#### 1. Preparation
- Ensure CLAUDE.md is up to date
- Provide clear problem descriptions
- Include relevant configuration context
- Specify expected outcomes

#### 2. Communication
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Reference NixOS documentation when relevant
- Explain custom requirements or constraints
- Ask for explanations of complex solutions

#### 3. Validation
- Test AI-suggested changes thoroughly
- Verify against NixOS best practices
- Check for security implications
- Ensure documentation accuracy

#### 4. Learning
- Understand the reasoning behind suggestions
- Learn Nix patterns and idioms
- Build knowledge for future development
- Contribute improvements back to documentation
